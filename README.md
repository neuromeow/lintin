# lintin

`lintin` is a command-line tool for linting [Ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)) inventories.

## Limitations

The existence of the project may seem redundant, especially given the availability of a tool like `ansible-inventory`, which allows to show Ansible inventory information in a convenient way and for different formats.

For the reasons stated above, it was decided to stop developing the tool and archive the repository.
